## Planetarium acceptance testing
### Overall grade 2 - okay
        Most of the requirements for the planetarium are enforced and most of the ones that are not
    are not application breaking and constitute a minor inconvenience, however the homepage showing
    other users moons is a signifigant and need to be addressed as soon as possible. Overall the application
    is fairly intuitive and the service is easy to figure out and use and the application overall looks visually good.
    Once the Problem of other users moons showing is resovled the app will do a good job inspiring condfidance in stakeholders.

## User Story 1
### Story grade 3 - good
        For the most part the user is able to register a new account with the planetarium.
    The only defect is that if a user enters a username already associated with an account
    the browser does not show a alert telling the user of the issue however requirements are
    enforced and the user can still easily create a new account. Overall the Planetarium does
    a good job imlementing User Story 1.

## User Story 2
### Story grade 4 - excellent
        No defects were found during testing of the login page. All requirements were enforced
    And the user can login to the planetarium easily. Overall the planetarium does an excellent
    implementing User Story 4.

## User Story 3
### Story grade 1 - bad
        When the user logs into their account they will be shown the planets and moons that
    belong to them, however they will also be shown the moons of other users. This not only 
    violates the requirements of User Story 3 but also clutters the homepage with data not
    relevant to the current user. The planetarium does does a bad job overall of implementing
    User Story 3.

## User Story 4
### Story Grade 3 - good
        When the user is on their homepage they can create new planets and moons associate with
    said planets, however if an invalid image format is submitted there is no alert informing
    the user making it difficult to know if anything has happened. Overall the planetarium does a good 
    job implementing User Story 4.

## User Story 5
### Story Grade 4 - excellent
        When the user is on their homepage they are able to delete planets and moons easily. When a planet
    is deleted the planets associated moon are also deleted enforcing the requirements for User Story 5.
    Overall the planetarium does an excellent job implementing User Story 5.
