# Sprint Retrospective

        Overall the project went well and I am very happy with my cucumber features as well as most of my code.
    I am also very happen with my Requirement Traceability Matrix it is well organised and for my first piece of documentaion
    I am proud of it. Despite being overall happy with the project there was lots of room for improvement. Two areas of improvement
    that I believe are related to each other are organisation and time management. While overall time managment was decent especially early on
    as the project got more complicated and development of the test suite began the quality of both time management and organisation began to suffer.
    Most of the issues that arose during development were due to poor organisation and if time wasnt lost due to these issues than the test suite would
    be much higher quality. There are a few things that are not finished and they are the the tests for user requirement 3 which was meant to test if only
    the current users planets and moons are being displayed however due to time constraints this part of the suite was never finished. Another part of the
    suite that was not complete was the happy path for deleting planets. The code is in place and is similare to the happy path for deleting moons however
    it is always failing even when it should be passing. The final part that was never implemented was testing if the user can directly access the homepage
    without logging in. This would have been fairly simple to implement however due to its simplicity it took a backseat to more important tests and when the
    organisational issues began to rear their heads it ended up being completely left out of the testsuite. Overall I am very happy with the outcome of sprint
    one and look foward to further development using the knowledge I have learned during this time.
